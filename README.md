# TechnicCraft
TechnicCraft is my attemp on learning OpenGl with a Minecraft clone.<br>
For now I attempt to create features similar to what you found in early Minecraft Alpha versions.
Later I hope to make it into a game quiet distinct from Minecraft, with special attention to
technic and automatisation. 


### Repository
This repository is base on my other repository [TechnicCraft-old](https://github.com/Trekki03/TechnicCraft-old).
It startes, where the other repository ended. But the complete buildsystem is transfered to MSBuild and the unit tests
are removed, at least for now.
